# Master Test Plan
**Project Name:** QA Showcase Portfolio
**Document Version:** 1.0
**Status:** DRAFT
**Author:** QA Automation Engineer (Portfolio Owner)

---

## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Objective
The objective of this Master Test Plan (MTP) is to define the testing strategy, scope, resources, and schedule for the **QA Showcase Portfolio**. This project is a dual-state web application ("Untested" vs. "Tested") designed to demonstrate advanced Quality Assurance and Test Automation capabilities to potential recruiters and hiring managers.

### 1.2 Audience
-   **Primary:** Recruiters, Hiring Managers, and Technical Leads evaluating QA competencies.
-   **Secondary:** Developers and QA Peers reviewing code structure and testing patterns.

---

## 2. Scope
### 2.1 In-Scope (Features to be Tested)
-   **"Untested" Experience:** Verification of the 5 intentional bugs (Null Reference, Broken Links, Layout Overflow, Data Type Mismatch, Resource Load Error).
-   **"Tested" Experience:** Verification of the clean state and "Green Tick" verification badges.
-   **Bug Reporting UI:** Functionality of the "Bug Card" and "Completion Modal" (Gamification).
-   **Navigation:** Sidebar and internal routing between views.
-   **Responsiveness:** UI fidelity across Mobile (375px), Tablet (768px), and Desktop (1280px+) Breakpoints.

### 2.2 Out-of-Scope
-   **Authentication:** No user login is implemented; public access only.
-   **Backend Database:** Data is mocked; no real API/DB performance testing required.
-   **Third-Party Integrations:** LinkedIn/GitHub external pages are not tested for functionality, only that the links redirect correctly.

## 3. Test Strategy
This project utilizes a **Hybrid Testing Strategy**, combining rigorous manual exploratory testing with a robust automated testing framework.

### 3.1 Agile & Manual Testing
-   **Exploratory Testing:** Session-based testing to identify edge cases and "unintentional" bugs (Quality Zero goal).
-   **Functional Testing:** Manual verification of the "Untested" narrative flow.
-   **Visual Inspection:** Pixel-perfect verification of UI components (Shadcn/UI) and themes (Dark/Light mode).

### 3.2 Automated Testing
-   **Framework:** Playwright (TypeScript).
-   **Pattern:** Page Object Model (POM) for maintainability and modularity.
-   **Coverage:**
    -   **E2E (End-to-End):** Critical user journeys (Landing -> Untested -> Bug Report -> Tested).
    -   **Regression:** Automated suite runs on every build/commit to ensure no new defects are introduced.
-   **CI/CD:** Tests are designed to run in a CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions - *Planned*).

### 3.3 Tools
| Tool | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Playwright** | Automation Framework (E2E) |
| **TypeScript** | Scripting Language |
| **Vite** | Frontend Build Tool |
| **Chrome DevTools** | Debugging & Network Analysis |
| **GitHub** | Version Control & Issue Tracking |

## 4. Test Environment
### 4.1 Hardware / Infrastructure
-   **Local Development Environment:** Windows 10/11.
-   **Browsers:**
    -   Chromium (latest) - *Primary*
    -   Firefox (latest)
    -   WebKit (emulation via Playwright)

### 4.2 Data
-   **Test Data:** Static mock data (JSON) used for Portfolio content.
-   **State Management:** LocalStorage used to track "Found Bugs" state.

---

## 5. Test Deliverables
1.  **Master Test Plan (This Document):** Strategy and governance.
2.  **Risk Register:** Analysis of project and product risks.
3.  **Test Cases:** Detailed step-by-step manual test scripts.
4.  **Traceability Matrix (RTM):** Mapping of Requirements -> Tests.
5.  **Automation Suite:** Fully executable Playwright codebase.
6.  **Test Reports:** Automated HTML reports generated by Playwright.

---

## 6. Entry & Exit Criteria
### 6.1 Entry Criteria (Start Testing)
-   Code is deployed to the local development server (localhost:5175).
-   Spec and Roadmap are marked as "Finalized".
-   Critical "Intentional Bugs" are implemented.

### 6.2 Exit Criteria (Release to Production)
-   100% Execution of all planned Test Cases.
-   100% Pass rate for the "Tested" path automation suite.
-   **Zero (0)** Critical/High severity "Unintentional" bugs open.
-   All 5 Intentional Bugs are verified as "present" in the Untested view.
-   All 5 Intentional Bugs are verified as "fixed" in the Tested view.

## 7. Risks & Mitigation
*Detailed analysis to be provided in `RISK_REGISTER.md`.*

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Resource Constraints** | Single resource project (QA + Dev). | Prioritize "Happy Path" automation; use strict timeboxing. |
| **Browser Flakiness** | Flaky tests due to React re-renders. | Use Playwright's auto-waiting and sturdy selectors (text/role). |
